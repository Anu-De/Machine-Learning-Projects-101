Breast Cancer Dataset Overview

The Breast Cancer dataset is a popular dataset used for binary classification tasks related to medical diagnosis. It contains features computed from digitized images of breast mass cell nuclei, with the goal of predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
Dataset Details

    Number of Samples: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset contains 569 samples.
    Features: 30 numerical features describing characteristics of cell nuclei, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension.
    Target Variable:
        Diagnosis: categorical label indicating whether the tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B).

Data Description
Feature Name 	Description

texture_mean 	Standard deviation of gray-scale values
perimeter_mean 	Mean perimeter of the tumor
area_mean 	Mean area of the tumor
smoothness_mean 	Mean smoothness of the tumor surface
compactness_mean 	Mean compactness measure
concavity_mean 	Mean measure of tumor concavity
symmetry_mean 	Mean symmetry of the tumor shape
fractal_dimension_mean 	Mean fractal dimension of the tumor surface
... 	... (other features like worst, standard error, etc.)
Usage

The dataset is widely used for training machine learning models to classify tumors as malignant or benign, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

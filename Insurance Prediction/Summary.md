1. Libraries and Data Loading

    Loaded necessary Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, xgboost).
    Loaded the dataset into a DataFrame.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Examined dataset info, descriptive statistics (info(), describe()).
    Checked for missing values, duplicated entries, correlations (corr()), unique values (nunique()), shape, and previewed the first few rows (head()).
    Visualized feature distributions with histograms.
    Identified potential outliers using box-and-whisker plots.

3. Data Preprocessing

    Applied feature scaling:
        StandardScaler for numerical features.
        Binary encoding for categorical variables.
        One-hot encoding for categorical features.
    Transformed data for modeling.

4. Train-Test Split

    Split data into training and hold-out test sets (e.g., 80/20 split).

5. Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning

    Trained multiple models with hyperparameter tuning:

    Linear Models:
        Linear Regression
        Ridge Regression
        Lasso Regression
        ElasticNet

    Tree-Based & Ensemble Models:
        Decision Tree Regressor (max_depth=5, min_samples_leaf=1, min_samples_split=2)
        Random Forest Regressor (max_depth=10, min_samples_leaf=4, min_samples_split=10, n_estimators=100)
        Gradient Boosting Regressor (max_depth=3, min_samples_leaf=4, min_samples_split=2, n_estimators=100)
        XGBoost Regressor (learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3, min_child_weight=10, n_estimators=100)
        K-Nearest Neighbors (n_neighbors=3, algorithm='brute', weights='distance')
        Support Vector Regression (C=10, epsilon=0.1, gamma=0.1)

    Evaluated models on training data with metrics like MSE, MAE, RMSE, R².

    Selected best hyperparameters based on validation performance.

6. Model Evaluation

    Assessed individual models' performance:
        Notable results:
            Gradient Boosting Regressor achieved an R² of approximately 0.82 on validation.
            Random Forest and Decision Tree also performed well.
            KNN and SVR had moderate performance.
    Observed that models like Gradient Boosting and Random Forest had the best validation scores.

7. Model Ensembling via Stacking

    Created a stacking regressor combining the top-performing models:
        Base estimators: Gradient Boosting, SVR
        Meta-estimator: Linear Regression
    Trained the stacking model on the training data.

8. Final Performance on Test Set

    Evaluated the stacking regressor on the hold-out test set.
    Reported performance metrics:
        MSE: 0.1582
        MAE: 0.21
        RMSE: 0.3978
        R²: 0.82

Conclusion:
The stacking ensemble achieved excellent performance, explaining over 82% of the variance with low error metrics, indicating a robust and well-generalized model.

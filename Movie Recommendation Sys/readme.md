Dataset Overview

The MovieLens dataset is a widely used dataset for building and evaluating recommender systems. It contains user ratings for movies, providing insights into user preferences and item similarities.
Dataset Details
Attribute 	Description
Number of Users 	Varies by version (e.g., 1M, 20M ratings)
Number of Movies 	Varies (e.g., 3,600 movies in the 1M dataset)
Ratings 	User ratings typically on a scale of 0.5 to 5.0
Time Stamps 	Ratings are timestamped for temporal analysis
Data Structure

    Users: Unique user IDs
    Movies: Movie IDs with associated metadata (title, genre, etc.)
    Ratings: User ID, Movie ID, Rating, Timestamp

Usage

The dataset is ideal for developing collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and content-based recommender systems. It helps in predicting user preferences and recommending movies accordingly.
Notes

    Multiple versions are available, such as 100K, 1M, and 20M ratings.
    Data preprocessing may include normalization, handling missing data, and feature engineering.
    Evaluation metrics include RMSE, MAE, Precision@K, Recall@K, and NDCG.
